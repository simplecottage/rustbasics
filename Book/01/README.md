`rustc filename`

# Cargo

To create a cargo project `cargo new`

To compile `cargo build`

output file is in `./target/debug/filename`

Or to build & run `cargo run`

To check if the code compiles without making the executable : `cargo check`

The file cargo.lock track the exact versions of dependencies of the project

Add the flag `--release` to compile with optimizations
